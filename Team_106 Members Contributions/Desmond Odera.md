# Backend development
#### I was tasked with creating the authentication system for the XL SWEEP web app
#### This involved coming up with the sign up and sign in systems and the permissions associated with these.
#### The system used the Django framework with Python for scripting. 
#### The project that was set up was named XLSWEEP: https://github.com/zuri-training/excel_comp_team_106/tree/main/XLSWEEP
##### The authentication system was hosted on the Accounts application: https://github.com/zuri-training/excel_comp_team_106/tree/main/Accounts
##### The project and applications hosted the models, views and necessary templates.
##### The ORM was used in place of SQL databases. This was done with the creation of models in the application.
